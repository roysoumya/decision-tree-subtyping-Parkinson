name: Decision Tree-based Approach to Robust Parkinson's Disease Subtyping using Clinical
  Data of the Michael J. Fox Foundation LRRK2 Cross-sectional Study
description: 'Parkinson''s Disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with
  high heterogeneity in clinical symptoms (motor and non-motor), progression course,
  treatment response, and genetic factors. Thus, PD subtyping aims to improve disease
  mechanism understanding and helps to facilitate targeted interventions or treatment
  regimens. Data-driven PD subtyping is typically done using cluster analysis, but
  such studies face difficulty from widespread adoption in clinical practice due to
  the following issues: (i) results are quite sensitive to study design, and actual
  subtype rules are not quite interpretable, (ii) results are not robustly replicable
  across multiple datasets, and most studies focus on a single dataset. In this paper,
  we aim to identify novel PD subtypes using an interpretable decision-tree-based
  method that is robustly reproducible in an independent PD cohort. We first train
  a decision tree binary classifier on the LRRK2 Cross-sectional Study dataset to
  determine whether a PD patient has early or late onset PD. Each leaf of the learned
  decision tree is considered a candidate subtype and by tracing the path in the tree
  subtyping rules can be established. We undertake a significant annotation effort
  for mapping features between the LRRK2 dataset and an independent PD cohort (the
  first validation study of the Movement Disorder Society Non-Motor Rating Scale,
  which will be referred to as MDS data) that is used for external validation for
  the identified subtypes. To ensure validity, the candidate subtypes are subjected
  to two stages of filtering based on both LRRK2 and MDS data. We finally obtained
  six novel subtypes (one primarily early onset, three primarily late onset, and two
  mixed onset) that are clinically consistent and sufficiently large (in terms of
  patient count) across both training (LRRK2) and external validation (MDS) datasets.
  Finally, a clinical characterization study showed that the following clinical features
  may be the most important diagnostic markers for our six detected subtypes: (i)
  persistent asymmetry affecting the side of onset most, (ii) clinical course of 10
  years or more, and (iii) postural instability not caused by other dysfunction.'
